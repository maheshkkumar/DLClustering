A method to employ a neural network to learn the latent representation of the multimedia data (e.g., images) to better form the clusters in a lower dimensional space.

## Steps to setup the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Setup the `python 2.7` environment (either conda or pip)
3. Install all the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `test.py -h` to know the additional command line parameters.
